# Welcome to WaxBuilder
WaxBuilder is a tool built on the shell of Wax, a minimal, static site-builder for digital collections. WaxBuilder includes added features borrowed from CollectionBuilder, including different data download formats, a timeline, an interactive web map, subject tags, and more.

Each include, layout, and folder includes a doc entitled "doc.md" that provides information about how to use that folder or file to customize your site.

Before using WaxBuilder, I suggest you familiarise yourself with Wax, including the Wax documentation. You may need the supplemental documentation for Wax, available from Cornell University's Digital CoLab (insha'Allah, coming soon) to help you, since Wax's documentation is scant.

## _data
The data folder contains your most essential files, including the:
  - Raw images
  - Config files for the map (config-map.csv and config-theme-colors.csv)
  - Your uploaded metadata csv
  - theme.yml file
