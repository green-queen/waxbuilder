# Welcome to WaxBuilder
WaxBuilder is a tool built on the shell of Wax. WaxBuilder includes added features borrowed from CollectionBuilder, including different data download formats, a timeline, an interactive web map, subject tags, and more.

Each include, layout, and folder includes a doc entitled "doc.md" that provides information about how to use that folder or file to customize your site.
