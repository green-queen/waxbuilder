An include is a section of code that can be added to another piece of code by calling {% include "include_name" %}.

To add any of the includes in this folder to another piece of code or a page, use {% include "include_name" %}, replacing "include_name" with the name of the include in this folder, with no quotations or file format ending (e.g. docs instead of docs.md). 

WaxBuilder only uses HTML includes, which means that all of the includes in this folder are in HTML only.
